# Simon-s-Game
Simon's Game is a classic memory-based electronic game brought to life on the web through a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features a simple yet engaging user interface designed with HTML and styled using CSS to create an intuitive and visually appealing experience.

Players are challenged to follow and repeat a sequence of colored buttons that light up and play corresponding tones. The game board, implemented with HTML elements, showcases a series of vibrant buttons, each representing a unique color. CSS is employed to enhance the aesthetics, providing a polished look to the buttons and the overall layout.
The interactive and dynamic aspects of the game are achieved through JavaScript. The scripting language is responsible for generating random sequences, managing user input, and validating whether the player successfully replicates the pattern. As players progress through the levels, the sequences become increasingly complex, testing their memory and concentration skills.

Audio feedback, facilitated by JavaScript, adds an auditory dimension to the gaming experience, with each button producing a distinct sound when pressed. The combination of visual cues, audio feedback, and responsive design creates an immersive and enjoyable gameplay environment.
